# ska engine
ska engine, a light and basic 2D engine to build simple games.

ska uses **SDL2**, with **SDL2_image**, **SDL2_ttf**, **SDL2_mixer**, all under _zlib_ license.
ska also uses **SDL2_giflib_sa**, an unofficial extension based on SDL in order to provide GIF animation support (credits : drx a.k.a. Cédric Van Den Bussche, see more at https://github.com/theMealena/SDL2_giflib_sa) under _LGPL3_ license.

For the physics, ska uses **Chipmunk2D** under the _MIT_ license.

# Made with ska engine (by me, for now...)
