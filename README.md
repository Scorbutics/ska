# ska engine
ska engine, a light and basic 2D engine to build simple games.

ska uses SDL2, with SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer, all under zlib license.
ska also uses SDL2_giflib_sa, an unofficial extension based on SDL in order to provide GIF animation support (credits : drx a.k.a. Cédric Van Den Bussche, see more at https://github.com/theMealena/SDL2_giflib_sa) under LGPL3 license.
